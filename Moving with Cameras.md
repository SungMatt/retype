# Moving with Cameras

This lesson is a short one on static cameras with pan, tilt and roll.
Second part of the lesson is with gimbal usage, for smoother camera shots.

## Lesson Plan
| Duration | Title   | Idea                                                                                                                         |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5m       | Recall  | Quickly test understanding on pan tilts and rolls, identify where they are from                                              |
| 10m      | Discuss | Talk about music videos / movies they have seen with moving cameras. Discuss and identify the types of movements encountered |
| 10m      | Plan    | Plan a quick 20s shot with two movements.                                                                                    |
| 20m      | Execute | Attempt to shoot it with a hands-on element                                                                                  |
=== Music Videos
Looking for some inspiration? You can look into a few:

1. This Too Shall Pass - OK Go
2. Rewrite The Stars - Cast of The Greatest Showman
3. The Writing's On The Wall - OK Go
4. Physical - Dua Lipa

## Movement Shoot ideas
Trucking along a coridoor to illustrate movement into a room
Dolly backwards, with subject following camera
Over The Shoulder, camera following subject

Orbit - pointing at subject in center, camera moving in a circle around subject

Boom arm -- Camera points at subject, camera moves in an upward arc. Requires monopod + gimbal.

## Bonus Content

If you have extra time, you can explore the dolly zoom. This involves moving backwards, and zooming in (or the reverse) to get the warped background effect.
